Welcome to a long-time user's POV on How to
Switch to Linux.

# WHAT IS A LINUX?
Linux is actually NOT an operating System
itself, it is a Kernel (the heart of the OS)
And because of that There are many 
Linux-based Operating Systems (Distros)
That cater to Different types of Users.

For Example:
Ubuntu is a Linux Distro for Normal Users.
Debian is a Linux Distro for Server Users.
Android is a Linux Distro for Phones.
