How to Switch from Windows to Linux!

Switching to Linux may look hard, but it's
just a matter of wrongdoing. Depending on
the Linux Distribution, it could be really
easy or really hard.

# DON'T BE LIKE PEWDIEPIE WHO'S FIRST DISTRO WAS ARCH. NEVER.

Welcome to a long-time user's POV on How to
Switch to Linux.
------------------------------------------
# WHAT IS A LINUX?
Linux is actually NOT an operating System
itself, it is a Kernel (the heart of the OS)
And because of that There are many 
Linux-based Operating Systems (Distros)
That cater to Different types of Users.

For Example:
Ubuntu is a Linux Distro for Normal Users.
Debian is a Linux Distro for Server Users.
Android is a Linux Distro for Phones.
